Given an array prices[] representing stock prices, find the maximum total profit that can be earned by buying and selling the stock any number of times.

Note: We can only sell a stock which we have bought earlier and we cannot hold multiple stocks on any day.

Examples:

Input: prices[] = [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]
Output: 865
Explanation: Buy the stock on day 0 and sell it on day 3 = 310 - 100 = 210 and Buy the stock on day 4 and sell it on day 6 = 695 - 40 = 655 so the Maximum Profit  is = 210 + 655 = 865.# Max-profit-array
